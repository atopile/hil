# HiL Validation Suite ðŸ§ª

Hardware-in-the-Loop, or HiL (sometimes HitL), is a way to continuously validate your hardware and firmware together. By connecting actual hardware to virtual test scenarios, HiL enables thorough testing of embedded systems, control units, and firmware under realistic conditions without the risks and costs of full physical testing.

HiL testing catches integration issues early, accelerates development cycles, and ensures robust system performance before deployment. Typically the domain of the most sophisticated automotive and aerospace companies, this HiL suite is now for all ðŸš€.

## The magic HiL suite ðŸª„

Project goals and aspirations:

 - Continuously validate your firmware, before each PR, on all of your hardware platforms
 - Automate your hardware validation, rather than poking and prodding it on a lab bench
 - Be the best developer board you've ever used

### Non-goals

 - Generic lab equipment. Sometimes these things look really similar, however generic lab equipment places an emphasis on performance, robustness and self-containedness that makes it a generic tool, rather than an embedded custom-built tool for a specific application. If there are modules in this suite you want to use generically, **awesome!**. It however isn't our goal to create them
